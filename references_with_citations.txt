CITED IN:
- "...learning-curve syntheses and council/agency outlooks project gradual system-level CAPEX declines toward ~$600-$1,200/kW by ~2030 contingent on multi-GW scaling, with stack-specific learning typically outpacing full system learning due to BOP constraints."
- "Our electrolyzer performance assumption of 57.5 kWh/kg H2 (system level) represents current commercial PEM technology as validated by multiple sources. This efficiency corresponds to approximately 57% based on the lower heating value, falling within the 55-69 kWh/kg range reported in comprehensive technology reviews. The assumed capital cost of $2,000/kW installed aligns with recent market assessments and serves as a conservative baseline given projected cost reductions."
- "Electrolyzer capital cost: A ±50% variation in electrolyzer CAPEX yields ±17.5% LCOH change. While significant, this sensitivity remains lower than capacity factor impacts, supporting the primacy of site selection."

- "Empirical WACC surveys and cost-of-capital syntheses locate onshore wind financing at ~6%-11% nominal (country/policy dependent), with ~7%-10% typical for developed markets and higher effective rates appropriate for standalone, merchant, or early-stage hydrogen projects; therefore, r=10% over 20-25 years is conservative but reasonable for Canadian standalone wind-hydrogen facilities."
- "The 10% discount rate represents a conservative estimate for standalone renewable hydrogen projects, falling within the empirically observed 8-12% range for Canadian onshore wind projects and above the 6-7% rates typical for established technologies with policy support."

- "The capacity factor, a key economic metric quantifying the ratio of actual to theoretical maximum energy production, was determined following standard industry practice."
- "The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from wind generation was calculated using established methodology for renewable energy project economics."
- "TEAs consistently annualize capital via the capital recovery factor CRF = r(1+r)^T/[(1+r)^T-1] and compute wind LCOE as the sum of annualized capital and fixed O&M over annual net generation, which then feeds the hydrogen LCOH through SEC and electrolyzer annualization; standard calculators and cost-of-wind reviews document parameter ranges and provide transparent reference values for FCR/WACC and lifetimes."
- "International TEAs span unsubsidized LCOH from about $3.5-15/kg depending on CF, electricity price, and financing, with European offshore clustering around $5-9/kg at 45%-55% CF and U.S. onshore spanning roughly $5.5-12/kg under 2024 conditions."
- "These values represent current market prices, updated from historical values to reflect technology maturation and market dynamics observed in recent cost assessments."
- "Viable (40%-55%): $5.50-$9.00/kg for locations such as St. John's, Stephenville, Ingonish Beach, Lethbridge, and Pincher Creek. This range corresponds to the median values in recent Canadian assessments (CAD 4.20-6.30/kg) and falls within established land-based wind ranges."
- "Our results align closely with contemporary international assessments while revealing Canada's competitive advantages. The $4.85-$5.50/kg range for top-tier sites matches or exceeds performance reported in European offshore studies and falls below typical U.S. onshore wind-hydrogen costs of $5.50-$12.16/kg."
